# RKE (Remote Keyless Entry)
# Problem Statement
Remote keyless entry (RKE) system is a system designed to remotely lock or unlock access to automobiles.  RKE functions are printing lock , unlock, alarm activation/deactivation, approach light.As many of us know there were lot of thefts happening in recent times in automobiles either the vehicle or personal things so here is the solution where we can unlock our automobiles with RKE.
# Introduction
The term far off keyless framework (RKS), likewise called keyless section or distant focal locking, alludes to a lock that involves an electronic controller as a key which is enacted by a handheld gadget or naturally by nearness. Broadly utilized in vehicles, a RKS fills the roles of a standard vehicle key without actual contact.
# Description
  Now a days as we are noticing that many of the automobiles work on this framework it is widely used for remotely lock or unlock vehicles as earlier many of the car manufacturers have gone through this process but at present even many motor vehicles following this framework to keep their automobiles secured.Actually the principle behind this is RKE  transmission requires two parts - a transmitter and a recipient. Transmitter - RKE key dandy, other ID gadget with RKE coordinate Recipient - Body Control ECU, other ECU with coordinated RKE.It works by communicating radio waves on a specific recurrence unidirectionally.RKE frameworks execute encryption and moving code calculations to forestall vehicle criminals from blocking and ridiculing the messages.Typical RKE capacities are:Print lock - (Blue switch on-All driven on simultaneously),     Print open - (Blue switch press twice All begun simultaneously),Print caution enactment/deactivation - (Blue switch press multiple times-All drove on in clockwise way),Print approach light - (Blue switch press multiple times-All drove on in enemy of clockwise way).This is the modern solution.
